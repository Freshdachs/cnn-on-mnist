    "##### Why Use Tensorboard?\n",
    "Tensorboard is a tool to investigate the training process of a tensorflow session. This promises 2 major benefits:\n",
    "  1. Gain a better understanding about the learning process and analyze the impact of network designs\n",
    "  2. In turn, a better understanding accelerates the optimization process\n",
    " \n",
    "Thus using Tensorboard might have a critical impact on both leraning more about neural networks and on our capabilites at developing high performance networks.\n",

    "## Some Theory on Tensorboard\n",
    "Tensorboard processes Tensorflow events files which contain summary data from running Tensorflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### General lifecycle\n",
    "We start with a complete computation graph that determines our whole training process. To this graph, we add summary operations on nodes we want to analyze in TensorBoard. We might want to measure how:\n",
    "- the learning rate changes\n",
    "- the objective function changes\n",
    "- distribution of activations from a particular layer\n",
    "- distribution of gradients and weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Therefore we connect summary operations such as histogram_summary (distributions) or scalar_summary (general rates) to the nodes we want to observe.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Since only the nodes are run which are required for the computations of nodes we explicitly require, we have to add these summaries to our executions. We can get an aggregate summary node with tf.merge_all_summaries. To write this summary to disk, we have to pass the summary protobuf to tf.train.SummaryWriter. The SummaryWriter requires a logdir and can also take a graph object. If we pass such a graph object, we can also inspect the graph in Tensorboard.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  We could run the merged summary op in every single step and record a ton of training data."
